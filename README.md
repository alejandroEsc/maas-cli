# MAAS-Client-Sample

Work in progress, here you will find two different applications:

- client: containing a sample client.
- maascli: containing an actual (as of yet very rough) cli tool.

One goal of this project is to get usable maas-client library code example so one
can learn to use the api tools provieded by the [https://github.com/juju/gomaasapi](https://github.com/juju/gomaasapi) project.

Note: That make file cannot be trusted as code is still work in progress.
